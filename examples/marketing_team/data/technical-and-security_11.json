    "text": "Since the upgrade in July 2023, aelf has reduced transaction fees from an average of approximately 0.3 ELF to around 0.003 ELF.To enjoy a daily exemption of 1 ELF worth of transaction fees, your wallet address needs to:Hold 10 ELF or more; orHold 5 USDT or more.If an address holds both more than 10 ELF and 5 USDT simultaneously, the exemption is increased to 2 ELF per day.You may read more here: https://medium.com/aelfblockchain/aelf-contract-upgrade-and-parameter-change-december-2023-19c8668fd2e0If address A has a balance of 10 ELF or more at 1:00 UTC today, it can enjoy a fee exemption of 1 ELF for the next 24 hours. During this 24-hour cycle, if the 1 ELF fee exemption is used up, subsequent transactions will incur standard fees. The fee exemption will reset to 1 ELF at the beginning of the next 24-hour cycle, regardless of whether the fee exemption is fully utilized during the first 24-hour cycle.If address A has a balance of 10 ELF at 1:00 UTC today but transfers out 7 ELF at 2:00 UTC today, the transfer of 7 ELF from address A can still benefit from the fee exemption. However, to continue enjoying the fee exemption in the next 24-hour cycle, the balance must be replenished to at least 10 ELF.",
