    "text": "The nodes on the aelf blockchain serve several critical purposes, contributing to the network's functionality and stability:Block Producers (BPs): BPs are responsible for producing new blocks and participating in decision-making processes, such as upgrades to smart contracts. By distributing nodes across various participants, aelf network achieves decentralisation. This reduces the risk of a single point of failure and enhances the robustness and reliability of aelf blockchain.Candidate Nodes (CNs): CNs maintain a complete copy of the blockchain and help propagate transactions and blocks across the network. They ensure that all participants have access to the latest blockchain data and facilitate network communication.In summary, aelf nodes play essential roles in maintaining the blockchain's operation, ensuring its security, decentralisation, and effective performance.",
