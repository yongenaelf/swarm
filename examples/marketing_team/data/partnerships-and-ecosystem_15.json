    "text": "Some aelf ecosystem DApps, like Portkey Wallet, ETransfer, and eBridge, can use tokens on either the MainChain or dAppChain, while other DApps, like Awaken and Forest, only support the aelf dAppChain, depending on the specific application and its design. Generally, more complex operations, such as DApp interactions, are often handled on aelf dAppChains to enhance scalability and reduce congestion on the MainChain.Typically, when you stake tokens or earn rewards through staking and voting on aelf governance, these activities are carried out on the MainChain. However, if you stake tokens or earn rewards through ecosystem DApps, it depends on the specific rules of those DApps; most of them are carried out on the aelf dAppChain.If the DApp you are interacting with requires tokens on the aelf dAppChain, and you currently only have tokens on the MainChain, you will need to transfer those tokens from the MainChain to the aelf dAppChain first. This transfer can usually be done within your Portkey Wallet.",
