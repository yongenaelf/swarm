    "text": "The maximum supply of ELF is hard-capped, which means that the total supply of tokens is fixed and cannot be increased. This is different from a soft-capped supply, where the maximum supply can be increased or adjusted over time. The hard-capped maximum supply of ELF ensures that there is a finite amount of tokens available and the supply is not inflationary. It also provides transparency and predictability to token holders and investors.",
