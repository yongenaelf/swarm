    "text": "aelf's unique strength lies in its underlying architecture, which utilises a multi-layered structure comprising a MainChain and multiple dAppChains. This differs from a traditional Single Chain system in that aelf is a \"Branched Ecosystem\", where the MainChain works as the backbone of the system and connects to multiple dAppChains. Compared with the traditional \"one Chain to any type of Contract\", aelf's \"One Chain to one type of Contract\" design allows aelf to distribute tasks efficiently and process transactions in parallel, significantly enhancing scalability and reducing congestion. At the same time, the aelf dAppChains are easier to manage and can be tailored for specific applications, enabling aelf to support a wide range of use cases without compromising performance.The C# programming language forms the foundation of the entire aelf blockchain, which underpins aelf's ability to handle high transaction volumes and complex operations with ease. C# also offers a powerful foundation for AI integration in blockchain development, primarily due to its alignment with the .NET ecosystem, which provides a wide range of libraries and tools that facilitate the development of sophisticated AI models, including the integration of machine learning algorithms, natural language processing (NLP), and data analytics. The integration of AI into the aelf ecosystem marks a significant advancement in the blockchain's operational capabilities which not only optimises performance and security, but also plays a crucial role in transitioning mass Web2 users to Web3 by significantly improving the overall user and developer experience.For more information regarding what makes aelf the preferred choice for developers and users, please refer to our Whitepaper v2.",
