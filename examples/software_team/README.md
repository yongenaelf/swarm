# Software Development Team Example

This example demonstrates a typical software development team with each agent in charge of different roles working together to iterate on an idea using the Swarm framework. The agents include a Developer, a Tester, and a Project Manager.

## Agents

1. **Developer**: Responsible for writing code.
2. **Tester**: Responsible for testing the code.
3. **Project Manager**: Responsible for managing the project and coordinating between the Developer and Tester agents.

## Setup

Once you have installed dependencies and Swarm, run the example using:

```shell
python3 main.py
```
